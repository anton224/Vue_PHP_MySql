# Vue_PHP_MySql

By creating this project I wanted to try out implementing a simple dashboard using Vue as a front-end and PHP as a back-end.
I've followed a tutorial on Youtube.


# Project
Manage users through dashboard.
It shows users and allows to Add, Remove and Edit each one of them.


# Structure
There are 3 files in the repository:

1. index.html
Generates the html code.

2. main.js
Vue app which manages the state of the application, sends requests to API endpoints 
and adds functionality to the interface.

3. process.js
API endpoint for handling all the interactions with the database.
There are 4 endpoints - Read / Create / update / Delete.
