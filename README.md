# Vue_PHP_MySql

By creating this project I wanted to try out implementing a simple dashboard using Vue as a front-end and PHP as a back-end. <br/>
I've followed a tutorial on Youtube.


# Project
Manage users through dashboard. <br/>
It shows users and allows to Add, Remove and Edit each one of them. <br/>


# Structure
There are 3 files in the repository:

1.  <ins>index.html </ins> <br/>
Generates the html code. <br/>

2. <ins>main.js </ins><br/>
Vue app which manages the state of the application, sends requests to API endpoints 
and adds functionality to the interface. <br/>

3.  <ins> process.js </ins> <br/>
API endpoint for handling all the interactions with the database. <br/>
There are 4 endpoints - Read / Create / update / Delete.
